# Market-Sales
Each Salesperson will be assigned with a Target (no of products to be sold) for each months. Which is given to them based on their last month's Achievement (no of products sold) I.e. 10% Increased from the last achievement. Implement a model to predict the target Given to them for the next month based on their previous achievement instead of giving them simply a 10% hike.
